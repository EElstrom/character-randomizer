# character-randomizer
Originally developed as a project for generating random passwords.

Early C programming example based primarily on tests with if and do..while statements.
Has corruptable elements that are not addressed, specifically with scanf. The program is not robust and expects mostly proper inputs.
Runs primarily from generation file which has the menu and its subsequent function calls for appending random elements.
Incorporates an additional header with a rating capability, which is loosely based on web-based password rating systems available.

Portfolio example.
